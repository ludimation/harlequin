HARLEQUIN
=========

Puppeteering the internet.

HARLEQUIN is an interactive art technology through which participants navigate databases of corporeal images using body movement as an interface. A participant stands in front of a markerless motion-tracking device which senses body posture in real-time. As the participant moves, HARLEQUIN presents a flickering display of diverse body images—spanning time, space, and media—that mimic the participant’s pose. As such, HARLEQUIN demonstrates body language as a unifying thread throughout human history.
